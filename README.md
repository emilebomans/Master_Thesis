Market Making in a Portfolio of Assets

This research extends the classical inventory-based model of a dealer making the market in a single asset to a multi-asset framework. By considering a portfolio of assets, the model explicitly incorporates the interdependencies and correlations between asset inventories, which influence the dealer’s optimal bid and ask quotes. These dynamics, in turn, affect market liquidity and the price impact of trades, as well as the cross-asset interactions where a trade in one asset can alter the quotes for others. The multi-asset framework allows for a richer understanding of how inventory risk propagates across a portfolio and its implications for trading behavior. Comparisons with single-asset models provide insights into the role of asset correlations in shaping liquidity provision and price dynamics. The model can be analyzed theoretically and, depending on the chosen specification, implemented and simulated using tools such as Python, R, or Matlab to explore its quantitative implications.
